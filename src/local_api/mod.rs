//! The desktop app's embedded local API stack, extracted from
//! plain-desktop's `src-tauri/local/*`: async-graphql schema + executor,
//! hand-rolled HTTP/WS/TLS server, chat wiring, peer status, nearby
//! discovery, DLNA receiver, downloads and link previews. The Tauri
//! crate consumes this and stays a thin shell (commands + capture).
//!
//! Host integration goes through [`ShellHooks`] — everything the stack
//! needs from its host (persisted preferences, UI notifications, app
//! metadata) instead of a windowing-framework handle.
